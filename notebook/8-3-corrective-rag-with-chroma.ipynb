Traditional RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to inform and improve the generation of responses, but they often lack mechanisms to assess the quality and relevance of the retrieved information. This limitation can lead to the generation of inaccurate or irrelevant answers, especially when the retrieved documents do not sufficiently address the user's query.\n\nTo address this challenge, the concept of **Corrective RAG (CRAG)** has been introduced. `CRAG` enhances the RAG framework by incorporating self-reflection and self-grading mechanisms to evaluate the relevance of retrieved documents. By assessing each document's pertinence to the user's question, `CRAG` ensures that only the most relevant information is utilized in generating responses. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the generated answers but also reduces the reliance on additional data sources.\n\nIn this example, we implement a simplified version of the `CRAG` strategy using LangGraph and LangChain. While the full `CRAG` methodology involves steps such as knowledge refinement and partitioning documents into \"knowledge strips,\" this implementation focuses on the core idea of grading document relevance and supplementing retrieval with web searches when necessary. By leveraging tools like DuckDuckGo for web searches and incorporating query rewriting for optimized searches, this workflow demonstrates how `CRAG` principles can be effectively applied to enhance RAG systems.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Installing Required Packages\n\nThis code block installs the necessary Python packages quietly (`-q`) and upgrades them if they are already installed (`-U`).

By introducing a grading mechanism to assess the relevance of retrieved documents, the system ensures that only pertinent information contributes to the generation of responses, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy and reliability of the output.\n\nWhile this example omits the knowledge refinement phase for simplicity, it lays the groundwork for more sophisticated enhancements, such as partitioning documents into knowledge strips and implementing deeper self-reflection capabilities. Additionally, the incorporation of web search supplementation through DuckDuckGo demonstrates the system's ability to dynamically seek additional information when initial retrievals fall short, ensuring comprehensive and accurate answers to user queries.\n\nMoving forward, further refinements could include integrating advanced knowledge refinement techniques, expanding the range of data sources, and enhancing the grading criteria to capture more nuanced aspects of relevance. These enhancements would elevate the system's performance, making it a robust tool for a wide array of applications that demand precise and contextually appropriate language generation.\n","metadata":{}}]}
