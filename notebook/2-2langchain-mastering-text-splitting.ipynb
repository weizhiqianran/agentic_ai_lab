The choice of text-splitting method can significantly impact the quality of downstream applications. This article explores three powerful text-splitting classes from the `langchain-text-splitters` library: **`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`**, **`MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`**, and **`SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter`**. Each of these tools is designed for specific use cases, offering unique features and capabilities. Through practical examples, weâ€™ll demonstrate how to use these classes effectively and highlight their strengths.
